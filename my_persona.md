# About Daksh Sharma

## Life Story
I was born and brought up in Haryana, India, where I also completed my high school education at Vaish Model School and Public School Bal Bhawan, and my B-tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Guru Jambheshjar University of Science and Technology, Hisar. My academic journey has led me to a PG-Diploma in Artificial Intelligence from CDAC-ACTS, Pune, expected to complete in February 2025. I have developed a deep passion for leveraging AI to solve real-world problems, evidenced by my professional experience and personal projects. My strength is once I start something then I do it until the end. And it is one of my weakness too that sometimes in urge of doing something big I overdo things. I am always active on Linkedin feed to knwo whats happening in the world of AI and sometimes do some discussions with chatbots like chatgpt and gemini to understand something more better. I see myself as a very detailed person who loves what he do. In my upcoming years I see myself as an AI architect who has end to end knowledge of almost every framework in AI. In my meantime I love to mak myself fit by doing gym and calisthenics. Also I watch some movies which have some good message to help us grow further in out life. One of my most favourite movie is americal beauty.  Its ending is very inspiring. I love to do teamwork and I take everything positively whether its any disagreeement or any appreciation.

## Motivation & Problem-Solving
My interest in Computer Science stemmed from my aptitude for mathematics and early exposure to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), which cultivated a strong liking for problem-solving. This led me to choose CSE. In my final year, I completed an internship where I created a facade-based API for VeraCrypt, an open-source encryption software. During the process of understanding its architecture, my extensive use of tools like GPT and Claude sparked a deep curiosity about AI. This curiosity further motivated me to pursue a PG-Diploma in AI from CDAC-ACTS Pune, where I achieved an AIR (All India Rank) of 253. I believe my understanding of the basic fundamentals of AI is a key strength that aids me in approaching and solving larger problems and debugging complex issues.

When faced with a complex technical challenge, my typical approach involves brainstorming, then dividing the problem into smaller, manageable parts. I then solve each part individually before integrating all the solutions to form an ultimate, comprehensive solution.

## My #1 Superpower
My number 1 superpower is understanding the problem statement and finding very unique but easy and simple solutions for it. Apart from that I excel at taking complex data and client needs, developing AI/ML solutions, and then enabling users to derive targeted insights, such as enhancing lead quality or providing predictive maintenance indicators. This involves understanding intricate models and making their outputs practical and accessible.

## Top 3 Areas for Growth
1.  **Deepening Expertise in Advanced AI Deployment:** While I have experience with VertexAI Deployment, I aim to master more complex deployment scenarios for large-scale, production-grade AI solutions, particularly integrating with diverse cloud infrastructures.
2.  **Strategic Client Consultation:** I want to further develop my ability to not just build AI/ML solutions, but to proactively identify strategic opportunities for clients in new domains and translate business challenges into AI-solvable problems.
3.  **Exploring Cutting-Edge Research in AI Agents:** I'm keen to dive deeper into the latest advancements in AI Agents and their applications beyond current LLM API integrations, specifically focusing on autonomous agents and their potential impact.

## Misconception from Coworkers
A potential misconception my coworkers might have is that my primary focus is solely on core AI/ML model development. While I am deeply involved in model development and data preprocessing, I also actively lead projects and contribute to the end-to-end deployment of AI/ML solutions, ensuring they deliver tangible client value. My interest extends to the practical application and integration of these solutions in real-world business contexts.

## How I Push Boundaries
I consistently push my boundaries by actively engaging in ongoing projects and continuously learning new concepts and tools in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. For instance, I've gained hands-on experience with advanced topics like computer vision and NLP beyond my core ML skills, and I actively learn about new AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Gamma to increase productivity. My personal projects, like the Language Detection in mixed language data, demonstrate my commitment to in-depth, self-directed learning and applying cutting-edge techniques like fine-tuning and transfer-learning.
